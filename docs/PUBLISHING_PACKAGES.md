# üì¶ Publishing Packages to Official Repositories

This guide explains how to publish your Go Terraform Linter to official package manager repositories.

## üç∫ Homebrew Publication

### Option 1: Create Your Own Tap (Recommended)

A "tap" is a third-party Homebrew repository. This is the easiest way to distribute your package.

#### Step 1: Create a Homebrew Tap Repository

```bash
# Create a new GitHub repository named "homebrew-terraform-linter"
# The name MUST start with "homebrew-" for Homebrew to recognize it

# Clone your new tap repository
git clone https://github.com/heyimusa/homebrew-terraform-linter.git
cd homebrew-terraform-linter

# Create the Formula directory
mkdir -p Formula

# Copy your generated formula
cp ../go-terraform-linter/packages/homebrew/terraform-linter.rb Formula/

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add terraform-linter formula"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Update Your Release Workflow

Add this to your `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Update Homebrew Tap
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  uses: mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action@v3
  with:
    formula-name: terraform-linter
    formula-path: Formula/terraform-linter.rb
    homebrew-tap: heyimusa/homebrew-terraform-linter
    base-branch: main
    download-url: https://github.com/heyimusa/go-terraform-linter/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/terraform-linter-darwin-amd64
    commit-message: |
      {{formulaName}} {{version}}

      Created by https://github.com/mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action
  env:
    COMMITTER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COMMITTER_TOKEN }}
```

#### Step 3: Users Install Via Your Tap

```bash
brew tap heyimusa/terraform-linter
brew install terraform-linter
```

### Option 2: Submit to Homebrew Core (For Popular Packages)

This is for packages that meet Homebrew's acceptance criteria:

1. **Requirements**:
   - Package must be notable/popular
   - Stable, versioned releases
   - No duplicates of existing packages
   - Open source license

2. **Process**:
   ```bash
   # Fork https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core
   # Add your formula to Formula/terraform-linter.rb
   # Submit a Pull Request
   ```

## üì¶ Snap Store Publication

### Step 1: Register as a Snap Developer

```bash
# Install snapcraft
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic

# Login to your Ubuntu One account
snapcraft login

# Register your snap name (one-time only)
snapcraft register terraform-linter
```

### Step 2: Build and Publish Your Snap

```bash
# Build the snap package
cd go-terraform-linter
snapcraft

# Upload to store (will create a snap file)
snapcraft upload terraform-linter_*.snap

# Release to specific channels
snapcraft release terraform-linter <revision> stable
```

### Step 3: Automate with GitHub Actions

Add this to your release workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build and Publish Snap
  uses: snapcore/action-build@v1
  with:
    snapcraft-channel: stable

- name: Upload to Snap Store
  uses: snapcore/action-publish@v1
  env:
    SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN }}
  with:
    snap: terraform-linter_*.snap
    release: stable
```

### Step 4: Get Your Snap Store Token

```bash
# Export login credentials for CI/CD
snapcraft export-login --snaps terraform-linter --channels stable -

# Add the output as SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN secret in GitHub
```

## üç´ Chocolatey Community Repository

### Step 1: Create a Chocolatey Account

1. Go to [chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/)
2. Create an account
3. Get your API key from your profile

### Step 2: Prepare Your Package

```bash
# Generate the package
make chocolatey

# Install Chocolatey CLI tools (Windows)
# OR use Docker for cross-platform development
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace chocolatey/choco:latest
```

### Step 3: Test Your Package Locally

```bash
# Test installation locally
choco install packages/chocolatey/terraform-linter.nupkg --source .

# Test uninstallation
choco uninstall terraform-linter
```

### Step 4: Submit to Community Repository

#### Manual Submission:
```bash
# Push package to community repository
choco push packages/chocolatey/terraform-linter.nupkg --source https://push.chocolatey.org/ --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### Automated with GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- name: Publish to Chocolatey
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  run: |
    choco apikey --key ${{ secrets.CHOCOLATEY_API_KEY }} --source https://push.chocolatey.org/
    choco push packages/chocolatey/terraform-linter.nupkg --source https://push.chocolatey.org/
```

### Step 5: Package Review Process

- Chocolatey packages undergo a review process
- Initial packages may take several days to approve
- Subsequent updates are usually faster
