## Security Best Practices üõ°Ô∏è

### For Users

#### 1. Keep Updated
```bash
# Regularly update to the latest version
go get -u github.com/heyimusa/go-terraform-linter/cmd/linter@latest
```

#### 2. Secure Configuration
```yaml
# Use secure configuration practices
logging:
  level: "warn"  # Avoid debug logging in production
  file: ""       # Don't log to files in production

performance:
  enable_cache: false  # Disable cache in CI/CD environments
```

#### 3. Input Validation
- Always validate Terraform files before scanning
- Use exclude patterns to avoid scanning sensitive files
- Review scan results before taking action

#### 4. Access Control
- Run the linter with minimal required permissions
- Don't run as root or with elevated privileges
- Use dedicated service accounts in CI/CD

### For Contributors

#### 1. Code Security
```go
// Always validate inputs
func (r *SecurityRule) Check(config *parser.Config) []types.Issue {
    if config == nil {
        return nil // Don't panic on nil input
    }
    
    // Validate file paths to prevent path traversal
    if !isValidPath(config.File) {
        return nil
    }
    
    // Sanitize outputs
    return sanitizeIssues(issues)
}
```

#### 2. Dependency Management
```bash
# Regularly update dependencies
go mod tidy
go mod verify

# Check for known vulnerabilities
go list -json -deps ./... | nancy sleuth
```

#### 3. Secure Development Practices
- Use `gosec` for static analysis
- Run security tests before committing
- Review code for security implications
- Follow secure coding guidelines

## Security Features üîê

### Built-in Security Measures

#### 1. Input Sanitization
```go
// All inputs are sanitized before processing
func sanitizeInput(input string) string {
    // Remove potentially dangerous characters
    // Validate file paths
    // Check for path traversal attempts
    return cleanedInput
}
```

#### 2. Output Validation
```go
// All outputs are validated and sanitized
func validateOutput(issue *types.Issue) error {
    // Ensure no sensitive data in output
    // Validate issue structure
    // Check for injection attempts
    return nil
}
```

#### 3. Secure File Handling
```go
// Secure file operations
func readFileSecurely(path string) ([]byte, error) {
    // Validate file path
    if !isValidPath(path) {
        return nil, errors.New("invalid file path")
    }
    
    // Check file size limits
    if fileSize(path) > maxFileSize {
        return nil, errors.New("file too large")
    }
    
    // Use secure file reading
    return os.ReadFile(path)
}
```

### Security Rules

The linter includes security rules that detect:

#### 1. Credential Exposure
- Hardcoded passwords and API keys
- Database connection strings with credentials
- OAuth secrets and JWT tokens
- Azure/AWS provider credentials

#### 2. Access Control Issues
- Public access configurations
- Unrestricted ingress rules
- Excessive IAM permissions
- Missing authentication

#### 3. Data Protection
- Unencrypted storage resources
- Missing backup configurations
- Weak encryption settings
- Data retention issues

#### 4. Network Security
- Open security groups
- Unrestricted port access
- Missing network segmentation
- Insecure communication protocols

## Security Testing üß™

### Automated Security Tests

```bash
# Run security tests
go test ./... -tags=security

# Run static analysis
gosec ./...

# Run dependency vulnerability scan
nancy sleuth

# Run fuzzing tests
go test -fuzz=Fuzz -fuzztime=30s ./...
```

### Security Test Coverage

```go
// Security test examples
func TestInputValidation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        input    string
        expected bool
    }{
        {"../../../etc/passwd", false},  // Path traversal
        {"normal/file.tf", true},        // Valid path
        {"file.tf\x00", false},          // Null byte injection
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        result := isValidPath(tt.input)
        assert.Equal(t, tt.expected, result)
    }
}

func TestOutputSanitization(t *testing.T) {
    issue := &types.Issue{
        Message: "Password: secret123",  // Contains sensitive data
    }
    
    sanitized := sanitizeIssue(issue)
    assert.NotContains(t, sanitized.Message, "secret123")
}
```

### Penetration Testing

Regular penetration testing is performed to identify:

- Input validation bypasses
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Memory corruption issues
- Privilege escalation vectors
- Information disclosure

## Vulnerability Management üìã

### Vulnerability Assessment

#### 1. Severity Levels

- **High**: Information disclosure, authentication bypass
- **Medium**: Denial of service, data manipulation
- **Low**: Information leakage, minor security issues

#### 2. CVSS Scoring
All vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS 3.1:
- **Base Score**: Inherent vulnerability characteristics
- **Temporal Score**: Exploitability and remediation
- **Environmental Score**: Organization-specific impact

#### 3. Risk Assessment
```go
type Vulnerability struct {
    ID          string
    Title       string
    Description string
    Severity    string
    CVSS        float64
