  - Security Group rules (SSH/RDP world access, overly permissive rules)
  - Load Balancer security rules (SSL enforcement, access logging)

- **Azure Security Rules (25+)**
  - Storage Account security rules (HTTPS enforcement, public access, encryption, TLS versions)

## **Migration Guide**

### **From v1.x to v2.0**

#### **Go Version Upgrade**
```bash
# Ensure Go 1.21+ is installed
go version  # Should show go1.21 or higher

# Update dependencies
go mod tidy
```

#### **Rule Interface Updates**
If you have custom rules, update them to implement the new interface methods:
```go
// Add these methods to your custom rules
func (r *YourCustomRule) GetDescription() string { return "Your rule description" }
func (r *YourCustomRule) GetSeverity() string { return "medium" }
func (r *YourCustomRule) GetCategory() string { return "security" }
func (r *YourCustomRule) GetProvider() string { return "aws" }
func (r *YourCustomRule) GetTags() []string { return []string{"tag1", "tag2"} }
func (r *YourCustomRule) GetVersion() string { return "1.0.0" }
```

#### **Output Format Changes**
The output format has been enhanced. Update any parsing scripts to handle the new severity-based categorization and enhanced issue descriptions.
